// Chocolate Distribution Problem
// Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
// Each student gets exactly one packet.The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.

// Examples:
// Input: arr[]={7,3,2,4,9,12,56}, m=3, Output:2
// Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3,2,4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2.

// Input: arr[]={7,3,2,4,9,12,56}, m=5, Output:7
// Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3,2,4,9,7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9â€“2=7.
